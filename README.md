#### Platform-independent vs Portable:
After compiling our Java program, a separate file will be created for the compiled program known as the byte code of java. This byte code will not be in the executable stage. The main purpose of generating byte code for a program is to achieve platform independency which means this byte code generated in one platform can be executed in another. *Eg*: The one which makes the byte code generated in Windows OS to be executed in the UNIX OS is the JVM of the UNIX platform. As you understand the JVM is platform-dependent but the byte code generated by the Java program is platform-independent. The generated byte code can run on any JVM irrespectively which platform the JVM belongs to. Whatever the JVM in which the byte code runs the output remains the same. So, JVM is a portable but platform-dependent component which enables the platform independency of the byte code. Thanks to, [James Gosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling) :)

### Java Compared to Python 
• Syntax: Java has a more verbose syntax, meaning that it requires more lines of code to accomplish the same task as Python. Python has a more intuitive, easy-to-read syntax that is often described as "readable code."

• Performance: Java is generally considered to be faster than Python because it is a compiled language, while Python is an interpreted language. This means that Java code is compiled into machine-readable bytecode before it is executed, while Python code is interpreted at runtime. However, Python has libraries like NumPy and Pandas which makes it great for data-science and machine learning.

• Functionality: Both Java and Python have a large number of libraries and frameworks available, so they can be used for a wide range of tasks. However, Java is often used for enterprise-level applications and building Android apps, while Python is more commonly used for scientific computing, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

• Learning curve: Because of its simpler syntax, many people find that Python is easier to learn than Java. However, some argue that the simplicity of Python can make it more difficult to write complex, efficient code. Java, on the other hand, can take longer to learn but can make it easier to write complex, efficient code.

• Community: Both Java and Python have large and active communities, with many resources available for learning and troubleshooting. Java is used by many big companies, so there are many job opportunities for Java developers. Python is also popular, especially in scientific and data science communities.

### Java Compared to C
• Java is object oriented; C is procedural. </br>
• Java is portable as class files; C needs to be recompiled. </br>
• Java provides extensive instrumentation as part of the runtime. </br>
• Java has no pointers and no equivalent of pointer arithmetic. </br>
• Java provides automatic memory management via garbage collection. </br>
• Java has no ability to lay out memory at a low level (no structs). </br>
• Java has no preprocessor.

### Java Compared to C++
• Java has a simplified object model compared to C++. </br>
• Java’s dispatch is virtual by default. </br>
• Java is always pass-by-value (object references). </br>
• Java does not support full multiple inheritance. </br>
• Java’s generics are less powerful (but also less dangerous) than C++ templates. </br>
• Java has no operator overloading. </br>

### Java Compared to PHP
• Java is statically typed; PHP is dynamically typed. </br>
• Java has a JIT; PHP does not (but might in version 6). </br>
• Java is a general-purpose language; PHP is rarely found outside of websites. </br>
• Java is multithreaded; PHP is not. </br>

### Java Compared to JavaScript
• Java is statically typed; JavaScript is dynamically typed. </br>
• Java is a compiling language whereas JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language.</br> 
• Java uses class-based objects; JavaScript is prototype based. </br>
• Java provides good object encapsulation; Javascript does not. </br>
• Java has namespaces; JavaScript does not. </br>
• Java is multithreaded; JavaScript is not. </br>

### A simple class and its members
```
// Only one public class 
public class Programs.Circle { 

// A class field  
public static final double PI= 3.14159; 

// A class method:
public static double radiansToDegrees(double rads) {
return rads * 180 / PI; 
} 

// An instance field:
public double r; 

// Two instance methods: they operate on the instance fields of an object 
public double area() { 
return PI * r * r; 
} 

// Compute the circumference of the circle
public double circumference() {  
return 2 * PI * r; 
} 
} 
```
