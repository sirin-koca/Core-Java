## Main features of Java:
* Object oriented language
  1. Encapsulation
  2. Abstraction   
  3. Inheritance
  4. Polymorphism
* High level language 
* Platform independent 
* Portable - The WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere)
* Easy syntax
* Multithreaded
* Secure
* Robust

### Java Compared to C
â€¢ Java is object oriented; C is procedural. </br>
â€¢ Java is portable as class files; C needs to be recompiled. </br>
â€¢ Java provides extensive instrumentation as part of the runtime. </br>
â€¢ Java has no pointers and no equivalent of pointer arithmetic. </br>
â€¢ Java provides automatic memory management via garbage collection. </br>
â€¢ Java has no ability to lay out memory at a low level (no structs). </br>
â€¢ Java has no preprocessor.

### Java Compared to C++
â€¢ Java has a simplified object model compared to C++. </br>
â€¢ Javaâ€™s dispatch is virtual by default. </br>
â€¢ Java is always pass-by-value (object references). </br>
â€¢ Java does not support full multiple inheritance. </br>
â€¢ Javaâ€™s generics are less powerful (but also less dangerous) than C++ templates. </br>
â€¢ Java has no operator overloading. </br>

### Java Compared to PHP
â€¢ Java is statically typed; PHP is dynamically typed. </br>
â€¢ Java has a JIT; PHP does not (but might in version 6). </br>
â€¢ Java is a general-purpose language; PHP is rarely found outside of websites. </br>
â€¢ Java is multithreaded; PHP is not. </br>

### Java Compared to JavaScript
â€¢ Java is statically typed; JavaScript is dynamically typed. </br>
â€¢ Java is a compiling language whereas JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language.</br> 
â€¢ Java uses class-based objects; JavaScript is prototype based. </br>
â€¢ Java provides good object encapsulation; Javascript does not. </br>
â€¢ Java has namespaces; JavaScript does not. </br>
â€¢ Java is multithreaded; JavaScript is not. </br>

### A simple class and its members
```
// Only one public class 
public class Circle { 

// A class field  
public static final double PI= 3.14159; 

// A class method:
public static double radiansToDegrees(double rads) {
return rads * 180 / PI; 
} 

// An instance field:
public double r; 

// Two instance methods: they operate on the instance fields of an object 
public double area() { 
return PI * r * r; 
} 

// Compute the circumference of the circle
public double circumference() {  
return 2 * PI * r; 
} 
} 
```
