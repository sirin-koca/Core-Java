/*
 Java, there is a set of interfaces that define different types of collection.
 At the very top of the hierarchy is Iterable. All types of collection implement Iterable, and
 it declares the forEach method. Then, there is the collection interface, which extends Iterable.
 This interface declares all the methods that every collection must have.

 Iterable:
     Collection:
     - Set
     - List
     - Queue: FIFO
     - Stack: LIFO
     - Map: Key-value pairs. Does not extend Collection interface but regarded as part of the collection-framework.
